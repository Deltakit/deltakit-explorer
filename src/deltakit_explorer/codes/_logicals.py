    From Stack Exchange post:
    https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/37812/how-to-find-a-set-of-independent-logical-operators-for-a-stabilizer-code-with-st

    Explanation from post:
    Solves for the observables as part of completing a tableau. It works by finding
    operations that turn the stabilisers into single-qubit terms. The observables are
    then created by looking at what undoing those operations turns the other qubits
    into.

    The stabilisers are provided as stim PauliStrings and so are the operators returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stabilisers : Collection[PauliString]
        The stabilisers as stim pauli string objects.
    num_logical_qubits : int, optional
        The number of logical qubits these stabilisers are expected to have. If provided,
        exactly this number of elements will be extracted from the end of the completed
        Tableau. If the number of logical qubits is known, providing it is safer
        because we are not 100% sure whether it is guaranteed that the stabilisers in
        the Tableau are exactly the same as the ones inputted (or whether they can be
        linear combinations of them, in which case the algorithm will think it is a
        logical operator). No example has been found where this was an issue so far, but
        this is to be extra safe. By default, None.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[PauliString, PauliString]]
        The logical operators for the stabilisers provided. Each
        element in the list returned is an anticommuting pair
        of X and Z logical operators. Every other pair across and
        among commutes.

        This function has been taken from the following repository under the MIT
        licence: [bp_osd repository](https://github.com/quantumgizmos/bp_osd).

        The following modifications were performed:
            1. Add more detailed typing information (parameter types, return type).
            2. Remove two lines of code that were not directly used by the method:
                ```
                if self.K == np.nan:
                    self.compute_dimension()
                ```
            3. Change the names of the parameters of compute_lz to avoid a name clash.
            4. Remove all the `self.`.
            5. Add a docstring.
            6. Add typing to the internal `compute_lz` function.
            7. Only use dense matrices because the inputs are dense anyway.
            8. Add ``lx_preferred``/``lz_preferred`` to let a caller bias which
               representative is picked for a logical class, since the basis a
               plain kernel/quotient computation returns is not unique and a
               caller may rely on a structural property that isn't guaranteed
